Additional steps to take before and after:

You'll want to change the permissions back to exactly how you had them.
When you attempt to take ownership of the StikyNot.exe.mui file, take screenshots of the permissions settings.
There should be 5 users, 4 of which have "Read & Execute" and "Read" permissions only.
The 5th user is "TrustedInstaller" and it has all permissions checked except "Special permissions".

To give ownership back to TrustedInstaller, type "NT SERVICE\TrustedInstaller" into
the "Enter the object name to select (examples):" box on the "Select User or Group" window.
This is probably important, but I don't actually know (I didn't bother checking).

Now there's no need to
Delete any default font of Windows OS.
OR
Make any Registry Changes,
(which may affect the Windows working environment)

Follow these simply difficult steps and you can do magic ;-)

You can also download a .MUI editor (even notepad works, I did Notepad++) and modify the sticky notes .mui file and change the font to whatever you want.

Open this location "C:\Windows\System32\en-US"
Find: "StikyNot.exe.mui"
Take backup of this file (copy and paste it in this folder itself to be on safer side)
With it, I could successfully change the default font the sticky notes are using. Use Notepad to edit the .mui file and make changes.

In the Notepad, Find and Replace "Segoe Print" with the Font of your Choice.


Solve the Access Denied problem

You have to have administrative permissions on the .mui file, and take control of the file first and then add full access permissions for your user name.

Step by step:

- Right click the file -> properties
- Security tab -> Advanced
- Owner tab -> Edit
- Click your user name -> OK
- Permissions tab -> Change permissions
- Add...
- Enter your user name (OR click advanced to search for it OR select Users) -> OK
- Click the Top left check box (Allow > Full access) -> OK
- OK -> OK -> OK that's it, now you can access the file.
Then you can remove the write protection but you still can't overwrite the file because notepad doesn't let you save in that folder. 
So save the edited MUI file elsewhere and copy it into the "..\en-us" folder.

Also note that the "..\en-us" folder depends on your system language (e.g. "..\de-de" for german etc), but the filename itself always stays StikyNot.exe.mui.

Thanks
